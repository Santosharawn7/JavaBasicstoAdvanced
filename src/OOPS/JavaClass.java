//A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. A class can include:
//
//Fields (or instance variables) – These are variables that hold the state of an object.
//Methods – These define the behavior or actions that the objects of the class can perform.
//Constructors – Special methods used to initialize objects.
//Nested classes or interfaces – Classes or interfaces declared within another class.


//For Example




public class JavaClass {

    String make;
    String model;
    int year;
    double price;

}
